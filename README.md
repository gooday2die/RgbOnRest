# RgbOnRest
### A Python Library for Controlling RGB Devices 
>This is a upgraded version of [PyPeripheral](https://github.com/gooday2die/PyPeripheral) and [AllPeripherals](https://github.com/gooday2die/AllPeripherals) that I wrote 3 years ago.
  ### Motivation & Goal 
I got multiple RGB peripheral devices from multiple brands: Razer, Corsair, MSI, Asus and NZXT So, whenever I try to use a simple *rainbow shifting* effect for each devices, they do not sync. So the main goal of this project is to **"Provide a Python library for controlling every RGB devices all together"**
